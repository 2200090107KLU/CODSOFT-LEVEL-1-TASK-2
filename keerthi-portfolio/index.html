            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am a passionate Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT) student currently in my third year at KL University. My journey in the world of technology began with a fascination for computers and a desire to understand how they work. This curiosity has driven me to immerse myself in various aspects of programming, web development, and software engineering.</p>
            <p>During my time at KL University, I have honed my skills in multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, and C++. I have also developed a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and database management. My academic projects have given me hands-on experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications, and I am continuously exploring new technologies to expand my knowledge and expertise.</p>
